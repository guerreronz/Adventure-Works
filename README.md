## Context

The main goal of this exercise was to work with more advanced techniques that allow me to try beyond the fundamentals of querying, such as CTEs, joins, subqueries, 
window functions and more.

The Join clause is especially important because it allows to work with big databases without the need of using subqueries, which is difficult to read and could produce 
logical errors. CTEs are the best options for queries that require a modular approach and to circumvent certain restrictions in the language. Window functions are
essential for querying financial questions without the limitations that represent aggregate functions.


## Content

several keys and foreign keys, making relations with inside and outside departments.
